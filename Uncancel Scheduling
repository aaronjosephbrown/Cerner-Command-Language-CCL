;--set the cancel flags = null, which makes the case appear in anesthesia 
app so you can disassociate and reassociate
;--With nothing in the cancel fields, it lets you manipulate the case 
to get the case data off of the canceled record.

When I’m done moving the case data, simply make the case cancelled again with 
this query (the cancel data from step 1 before you un-canceled it):

update from surgical_case
set CANCEL_DT_TM = cnvtdatetime(curdate, curtime),
CANCEL_REASON_CD = xxxxxxxx.00,
CANCEL_REQ_BY_ID = xxxxxxxx.00
where SURG_CASE_NBR_FORMATTED in (“CaseNumber”,”CaseNumber") go
commit go
